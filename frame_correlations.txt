		 Key Insights

1. Cluster Stability
   - Internal cluster correlations are consistently high
   - Cross-cluster correlations show meaningful patterns
   - Negative correlations reveal response trade-offs

2. Response Patterns
   - Safety-focused responses show strong internal coherence
   - Emotional-presence linkage is robust
   - Social-behavioral connections are consistent

3. Strategic Implications
   - Safety and attention mechanisms are tightly coupled
   - Emotional regulation supports presence
   - Social positioning involves multiple frame interactions
