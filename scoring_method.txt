Frame Scoring Methodology

		 Base Score Components
1. Direct Frame Manifestation (weight: 0.4)
   - Primary core frame mentioned: +0.4
   - Secondary core frame mentioned: +0.2
   - Negation of frame: -0.3
   - Opposition to frame: -0.4

2. Emotional Alignment (weight: 0.3)
   - gioia → positive for AgencyExpression, PresenceEngagement
   - tristezza → negative for EmotionalRegulation, PresenceEngagement
   - sorpresa → variable based on context for CognitiveAssessment
   - disgusto → positive for SafetyManagement, negative for PresenceEngagement
   - paura → positive for SafetyManagement, AttentionManagement
   - rabbia → positive for EmotionalRegulation, negative for SocialPositioning

3. Embodiment Influence (weight: 0.3)
   - totalEmbo: general frame intensity
   - ontEmbo: physical/safety frames
   - functEmbo: cognitive/social frames

		 Normalization Process
1. Raw Score Calculation:
   ```
   raw_score = (direct_manifestation * 0.4) + 
               (emotional_alignment * 0.3) + 
               (embodiment_influence * 0.3)
   ```

2. Context Adjustment:
   - Frame relationships from ontology
   - Interaction effects between frames
   - Temporal sequence implications

3. Final Normalization:
   ```
   normalized_score = (raw_score - min_score) / (max_score - min_score) * 2 - 1
   ```

		 Frame-Specific Considerations

			 Action Pattern & Behavioral Response
- Direct behavioral descriptions: +0.4
- Avoidance behaviors scored differently based on context
- Physical actions weighted higher than intentions

			 Cognitive & Mental Processing
- Explicit reasoning processes: +0.3
- Situation analysis indicators: +0.2
- Comprehension barriers: -0.2

			 Emotional & Social Frames
- Direct emotional expressions: +0.4
- Social interaction quality: ±0.3
- Identity-related mentions: +0.3

			 Safety & Control Frames
- Explicit safety concerns: +0.4
- Control mechanisms: +0.3
- Environmental awareness: +0.2

		 Quality Control
- Cross-validation with core frames
- Consistency check across related frames
- Context preservation in scoring
