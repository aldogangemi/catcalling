This repository contains the material related to an immersive VR experiment on cat calling experiences.
The included files describe the subjects' data, their verbal reports, the knowledge graph (catcalling_reports.owl) extracted from the reports, 
jointly with an ontology (the schema from catcalling_reports.owl) of the extracted frames and their clusters, and files describing statistical data about the 
clustering of frames, their correlations with subjective measures, and the scoring method used to quantify
the intensity of cognitive/emotional frames.
